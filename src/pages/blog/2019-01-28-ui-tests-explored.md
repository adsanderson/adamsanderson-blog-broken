I thought I would explore my idea around there fundamentally only being [three types of test in a UI](https://www.adamsanderson.co.uk/blog/2018-12-31-a-ui-testing-approach/).

UI testing has a reputation for being hard and/or fragile. The trend towards components has improved the universal test coverage but it is still a difficult problem to solve.

### What are the three tests

Roughly the three tests are a follows:

> When an event occurs Then expect a state change to be triggered

> Given a state When a state change is triggered Then expect the state to reflect the changes 

> Given a state Then expect the UI to reflect that state

Testing becomes complex when
