Automated testing and architecture can feel very dogmatic at time; "you must", "never do", "this is the way". All of which can be much more comforting than a healthier reality of "well it depends".

Where these dogmas came from is people having pain doing things one way and finding a better way to do the thing they were doing. Then they were so excited they wanted to share. 



Lets start with a paradox, the [Paradox of Tolerance][1]. To paraphrase; for a tolerant society to survive it must not tolerate intolerance. This is what I think of when I see very dogmatic approaches to testing. The only dogma I have is "well it depends".  

Sometimes it's good to go back to fundimentals 

Like the 

- self testing code
- regression
- feedback
- intermediate steps
