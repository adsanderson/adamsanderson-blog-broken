It started with a tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unit tests are almost worthless. <a href="https://t.co/7aTmtOCqnv">https://t.co/7aTmtOCqnv</a></p>&mdash; David K. ðŸŽ¹ (@DavidKPiano) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1109954809732444162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2019</a></blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

and then the more interesting follow up:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love how this is a legitimately unpopular opinion ðŸ˜…<br><br>Better IMO: property-based testing (generated unit tests), integration, E2E, model-based testing, static typing.</p>&mdash; David K. ðŸŽ¹ (@DavidKPiano) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1109974822463983616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2019</a></blockquote>

I knew about integration tests, E2E tests and static types, I'd heard of property-based testing but had never delved too much. Model-based testing I had not heard of before and decided to look into it.
